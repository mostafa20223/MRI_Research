## Project Descriptiom
> **Abstract**
    
Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging PET/MRI combines metabolic and molecular information of PET with excellent anatomic details of MRI systems to enhance the image quality. PET/MRI is applied for cancer in areas of the brain, neck, and pelvis, which require a good distinction between diseased and healthy tissue due to their complex anatomic structure. The usage of PET/MRI, especially in an integrated system, depends on the development of components that avoid deleterious interactions caused by high magnetic fields of the MRI scanner and RF interference between the MRI and PET systems.
